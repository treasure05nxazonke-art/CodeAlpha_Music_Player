🎵 CodeAlpha Music Player

A modern, neon-styled Music Player Web App built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript, created as my final project for the CodeAlpha Frontend Development Internship.

This was my most challenging task, but also the most rewarding. I learned, struggled, fixed, broke things again 😅 — and finally built something I’m truly proud of.
